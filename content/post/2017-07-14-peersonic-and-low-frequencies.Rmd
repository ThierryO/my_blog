Recently Ren√© Janssen from [Bionet Natuuronderzoek](http://www.bionetnatuur.eu/) was looking for an automatic bat-detector which could record sounds starting from 4 kHz.
That was an incentive to put the Peersonic RPA2 to the test.

## Generating a test sound

For this test I needed a file with known frequencies over a given range.
It turns out that creating such a test file is relatively easy with [R](https://www.r-project.org).

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
source("../../helpers.R")
opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, dev = "png")
```


```{r}
library(tuneR)
# sample rate of the sound in Hz
# must be at least twice the highest frequency
sample.rate <- 50e3
# duration of the sound in seconds
duration <- 5
# lowest and highest frequency in the sound
sound.freq.range <- c(1e3, 21e3)
# number of steps between the lowest and higest frequency
sound.freq.steps <- 40
# time
t <- seq(0, duration - 1 / sample.rate, by = 1 / sample.rate)
# vector of frequencies
sound.freq <- seq(
  sound.freq.range[1], 
  sound.freq.range[2],
  length = sound.freq.steps
)
# stretch the frequency vector to 1 second
sound.freq <- rep(
  sound.freq,
  each = sample.rate / sound.freq.steps
)
# amplitude of the sound
u <- (2^15 - 1) * sin(2 * pi * sound.freq * t)
# create Wave object
w <- Wave(u, samp.rate = sample.rate, bit = 16)
# save Wave object to wav file
writeWave(w, "test.wav")
```

## Play and record the test sound

![Test setup with RPA2 detector.](/images/peersonic/peersonic_headphones.jpg)
Now I have a file [test.wav](/post/test.wav) which has sounds ranging from `r sprintf("%.0fkHz", min(sound.freq.range) / 1e3)` up to `r sprintf("%.0fkHz", max(sound.freq.range) / 1e3)`.
I played this file using [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) on a [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) laptop.
The laptop speakers failed to play sounds above 15 kHz, so I tried my [Philips SHB9850NC headphones](http://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/SHB9850NC_00/wireless-noise-cancelling-headphones).
Some testing revealable that I was able to hear sounds up to 22,5 kHz.
I'm not sure whether the headphones, my ears or both failed at higher frequencies ;-) So I placed the headphones over the Peersonic RPA2 as show in the photo.
Then the Peersonic was set in `auto record` mode with a threshold of `-30dB` and a maximum file length of `20` seconds.
The volume on the laptop was set about half way.
Then I played the test file several times.

## Comparison of the original test file and the recording

Let's first look at the spectrogram of the [test file](/post/test.wav).
Again, something which it not that hard with [R](https://www.r-project.org)

```{r truth-spec, fig.cap = "Spectrogram of the generated test file", message = FALSE}
truth <- readWave("test.wav")@left
library(signal)
window.n <- 1024
truth_spec <- specgram(
  x = truth,
  n = window.n,
  Fs = sample.rate,
  overlap = ceiling(0.9 * window.n)
)
plot(truth_spec, col = rainbow(10))
```

Then do the same thing with the file [A013_AMS.WAV](/data/test_peersonic/A013_AMS.WAV) as recorded by the Peersonic RPA2.
The Peersonic RPA2 records multiple of 5 seconds, hence the silence a the end.
Note that the test file did not contain frenquencies above `r sprintf("%.0fkHz", max(sound.freq.range) / 1e3)`.
The noise around 32kHz is probably due to the fan of my laptop.

```{r rec-spec-full, fig.cap = "Complete spectrogram of the recorded test file"}
recording <- readWave(
  "../../static/data/test_peersonic/A013_AMS.WAV", to = 5 * 384e3
)
window.n <- 1024
record_spec <- specgram(
  x = recording@left,
  n = window.n,
  Fs = recording@samp.rate,
  overlap = ceiling(0.9 * window.n)
)
plot(record_spec, col = rainbow(10))
```

I've zoomed into to the revelant section of the recording: the first 5 seconds and from 0kHz up to 30kHz.
The Peersonic RPA2 seems to record sounds as low as `r sprintf("%.0fkHz", max(sound.freq.range) / 1e3)`.
The sensitivy of the microphone seems to be a bit lower under 5kHz.

```{r rec-spec-detail, fig.cap = "Detail of the spectrogram of the recorded test file"}
plot(record_spec, col = rainbow(10), xlim = c(0, 5), ylim = c(0, 30e3))
```

## Session info

These R packages were used to create this post.

```{r}
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
