This post will handle observations of bats along a set of transects. It is a work in progress simply because I'm still collecting more data. So come back once and awhile to see potential updates.

# The survey

The principle of the survey is quite simple: walk around with a bat detector and note the route you took and were you encounter bats. Repeat this several times. I choose to take a different route each time so I can cover the same area at different times of night.

I use [ObsMapp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.obsmapp&hl=en) to trace the route and the observations. The bat detector is a [Peersonic RPA2](../peersonic/index.html) with [Philips SHB9850NC headphones](http://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/SHB9850NC_00/wireless-noise-cancelling-headphones). This set-up is quite handy. At the start of the route you start listening to the bat detector and tell ObsMapp to start tracking the route. Each time you encounter a bat you a) make a sound recording of the bat and b) mark the observation in ObsMapp^[can be done in as little as three taps.]. At home you upload the observations to [waarnemingen.be](https://www.waarnemingen.be), [waarneming.nl](https://www.waarneming.nl) or [observation.org](https://www.observation.org/). Then you check the observations based on the recorded sounds and update the observations on the website. Each survey is downloadable from the website under several formats. Here we will use both the [KML format](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/) and the csv format. The KML is required because it contains both the track of each route and the observations. The csv is needed for the date, the start time and end time of the track.

# Survey effort

First we have to download the surveys. We need some ugly code to get everything in a usable format. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ThierryO/my_blog/blob/master/content/post/2017-06-15-analysing-data-from-bat-observations-along-transects.Rmd). The result is the set of all tracks and observations (figure \@ref(fig:raw-data)).

```{r}
id <- c(35745, 36309, 37444, 38379)
source("../../source/waarnemingen_be.R")
if (file.exists("../../static/post/2017-06-16-transect/observation.txt")) {
  read.delim(
    "../../static/post/2017-06-15-transect/observation.txt",
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  ) %>%
    mutate(
      time = as.POSIXct(time),
      starttime = as.POSIXct(starttime),
      endtime = as.POSIXct(endtime)
    ) -> observation
} else {
  observation <- read_observation(id) %>%
    arrange(route_id, observation_id)
  if (!dir.exists("../../static/post/2017-06-15-transect")) {
    dir.create("../../static/post/2017-06-15-transect", recursive = TRUE)
  }
  write.table(
    observation, 
    file = "../../static/post/2017-06-15-transect/observation.txt",
    quote = FALSE,
    sep = "\t",
    row.names = FALSE,
    fileEncoding = "UTF-8"
  )
}
kml <- read_kml(observation = observation)
route <- kml$route
point <- kml$point
```

```{r raw-data, fig.cap = "Map with all tracks and all observations."}
leaflet(route) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines() %>%
  addMarkers(data = point)
```

We determine the survey effort as the cumulative proportion on the area of grid cells that a covered by a survey. So we start by defining a grid with `r sprintf("%1$ix%1$im", params$resolution)` resolution. Then we create of buffer on `r sprintf("%im", params$range)` around the tracks because assume that we can here most bats up to this distance on the bat detector. The result is a ribbon marking the area where we could have detected bats. The total area of ribbon per grid cell is an indicator of the total survey effort per grid cell (figure \@ref(fig:survey-effort)).

```{r}
route_local <- spTransform(route, CRS(params$crs))
route_buffer_local <- gBuffer(route_local, width = params$range, byid = TRUE)
route_buffer <- spTransform(route_buffer_local, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))
bb <- bbox(route_buffer_local)
grid <- expand.grid(
  x = seq(
    bb["x", "min"] - 0.5 * params$resolution, 
    bb["x", "max"],
    by = params$resolution
  ),
  y = seq(
    bb["y", "min"] - 0.5 * params$resolution, 
    bb["y", "max"],
    by = params$resolution
  )
) %>%
  mutate(
    dx = (x - min(x)) / params$resolution,
    dy = (y - min(y)) / params$resolution,
    id = paste(dx, dy, sep = "-"),
    node = seq_along(id)
  )
nx <- max(grid$dx) + 1
ny <- max(grid$dy) + 1
grid_local <- lapply(
  seq_len(nrow(grid)),
  function(i){
    cbind(
      x = c(0, 1, 1, 0, 0) * params$resolution + grid$x[i],
      y = c(0, 0, 1, 1, 0) * params$resolution + grid$y[i]
    ) %>%
      Polygon() %>%
      list() %>%
      Polygons(ID = grid$id[i])
  }
) %>%
  SpatialPolygons(proj4string = CRS(params$crs)) %>%
  SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(data = grid, match.ID = FALSE)
hull <- gConvexHull(route_buffer_local)
grid_local <- grid_local[!is.na(over(grid_local, hull)), ]
survey_effort <- gIntersection(grid_local, route_buffer_local, byid = TRUE) %>%
  gArea(byid = TRUE)
survey_effort <- data.frame(
  grid_id = gsub(" .*", "", names(survey_effort)),
  route_id = gsub(".* ", "", names(survey_effort)) %>%
    as.integer(),
  effort = survey_effort / params$resolution ^ 2,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
grid_local@data <- survey_effort %>%
  group_by(grid_id) %>%
  summarise(effort = sum(effort)) %>%
  left_join(x = grid_local@data, by = c("id" = "grid_id"))
grid <- spTransform(grid_local, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))
```

```{r survey-effort, fig.cap = "Map with total survey effort."}
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "Reds",
  domain = grid_local$effort
)
leaflet(subset(grid, !is.na(effort))) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(
    color = ~pal(effort), 
    stroke = FALSE,
    fillOpacity = 0.5
  ) %>%
  addPolygons(data = route_buffer, stroke = FALSE) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, values = ~effort,
    title = "Total<br>survey<br>effort",
    opacity = 1
  )
```

# Presence of bats

The number of observations per species is quite different. Only the common pipistrelle (_Pipistrellus pipistrellus_) has currently enough observations for the analysis (table \@ref(tab:observation-species)). Note that the table also contains other mammal species because I note all mammal species that I encounter.

```{r observation-species}
point@data %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  count(species) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    species = reorder(species, -n, sum)
  ) %>%
  spread(key = date, value = n, fill = 0) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Number of observations per species and per track"
  )
```

Next we check for each combination of track and grid cell whether we detected pipistrelles or not. Figure \@ref(fig:presence) displays the average presence over all tracks.

```{r}
pipistrelle <- subset(point, species == "Pipistrellus pipistrellus")
pipistrelle_local <- spTransform(pipistrelle, CRS(params$crs))
pipistrelle_local$grid_id <- over(pipistrelle_local, grid_local["id"])$id
survey_pipistrelle <- pipistrelle_local@data %>%
  distinct(route_id, grid_id) %>%
  mutate(present = 1) %>%
  left_join(x = survey_effort, by = c("grid_id", "route_id")) %>%
  mutate(present = ifelse(is.na(present), 0, present))
grid_local@data <- survey_pipistrelle %>%
  group_by(grid_id) %>%
  summarise(pipistrelle = mean(present)) %>%
  left_join(x = grid_local@data, by = c("id" = "grid_id")) %>%
  mutate(
    pipistrelle = ifelse(
      is.na(pipistrelle),
      ifelse(is.na(effort), NA, 0),
      pipistrelle
    )
  )
grid_distance <- grid_local@data %>%
  select(x, y) %>%
  dist() %>%
  as.matrix()
diag(grid_distance) <- Inf
grid_distance[grid_local$pipistrelle == 0 | is.na(grid_local$pipistrelle), ] <- Inf
grid_local$pipi_nn <- apply(grid_distance, 2, min)
grid <- spTransform(grid_local, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))
```

```{r presence, fig.cap = "Map with presence of common pipistrelle."}
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = rainbow(20, start = 2 / 3, end = 1),
  domain = grid_local$pipistrelle
)
leaflet(subset(grid, !is.na(pipistrelle))) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(
    color = ~pal(pipistrelle), 
    stroke = FALSE,
    fillOpacity = 0.5
  ) %>%
  addPolygons(data = route_buffer, stroke = FALSE) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, values = ~pipistrelle,
    title = "Presence of<br>common pipistrelle",
    opacity = 1
  )
```

Figure \@ref(fig:nearest-neighbour) show the distance from the centre of each grid cell to the centre of the nearest other grid cell were we detected common pipistrelle during the entire study. This can given an indication of clustering or repulsion.

```{r nearest-neighbour, fig.cap = "Map with nearest neighbour distance of common pipistrelle."}
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "RdYlBu",
  domain = grid$pipi_nn
)
leaflet(grid) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(
    color = ~pal(pipi_nn), 
    stroke = FALSE,
    fillOpacity = 0.5
  ) %>%
  addPolygons(data = route_buffer, stroke = FALSE) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, values = ~pipi_nn,
    title = "Nearest neighbour of<br>common pipistrelle",
    opacity = 1
  )
```

# Exploratory data analysis

The current analysis used only very basic variables: survey effort (fig. \@ref(fig:eda-effort)) and nearest neighbour distance (fig. \@ref(fig:eda-nn)).

```{r}
survey_pipistrelle <- survey_pipistrelle %>%
  inner_join(
    grid@data %>% select(id, node, pipi_nn),
    by = c("grid_id" = "id")
  )
```

```{r eda-effort, fig.cap = "Dection of common pipistrelle in terms of survey effort."}
ggplot(survey_pipistrelle, aes(x = effort, y = present)) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "gam", 
    formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs", k = 3), 
    method.args = list(family = binomial)
  ) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  xlab("sampling effort") + 
  scale_y_continuous("Detection", labels = percent)
```

```{r eda-nn, fig.cap = "Dection of common pipistrelle in terms of distance to nearest neighbouring grid cell were common pipistrelle was observed. A small jitter was added due to heavy overlap between points."}
ggplot(survey_pipistrelle, aes(x = pipi_nn, y = present)) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "gam", 
    formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs", k = 3), 
    method.args = list(family = binomial)
  ) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, height = 0.05, width = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous("Distance to nearest neighbouring grid cell (m)") +
  scale_y_continuous("Detection", labels = percent)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:prediction-mean) show the median predicted probability for common pipistrelle. This is an estimation of the change to encounter common pipistrelles in each grid cell. The lower credible limit of these prediction are useful to detect the important locations (fig. \@ref(fig:prediction-lcl)). The higher the lower credible limit, the more certain the model is about the presence of common pipistrelles. Likewise, the upper credible limit (fig. \@ref(fig:prediction-ucl)) is useful to detect locations where the model is more certain about the absence of common pipistrelle.

The [receiver operating characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) (ROC, fig. \@ref(fig:roc)) gives an indication of the quality of the model. It can be summarised by the [area under the curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve) (AUC). The closer the AUC value get to 1, the better the model.

```{r roc, fig.cap = "Receiver operating curve."}
observed_index <- inla.stack.index(stacks, "observation")$data
dataset <- data.frame(
  fitted = m$summary.fitted.values[observed_index, "mean"],
  observed = survey_pipistrelle$present
