[`inlabru`](https://www.inlabru.org) is an R package which builds on top of the [`INLA`](https://www.r-inla.org) package. I had the opportunity to take a workshop on it during the International Statistical Ecology Workshop [ISEC2018](https://www.isec2018.org) in St Andrews. This was a five day workshop condensed into a single day, hence the pace was very high. It gave us a good overview of the possibilities of `inlabru` but no time to try it on our own data.

`inlabru` has two main functions: `bru` and `lgcp`. `bru` is a wrapper for `INLA::inla`. `lgcp` is intended to fit log Gaussian Cox processes. I will focus on `bru` and compare it with `INLA::inla` as I find that `bru` makes things a lot easier.

# Tundra bean goose

The test data is derived from the "Wintering waterbirds in Flanders, Belgium", freely available at GBIF (https://doi.org/10.15468/lj0udq). I've extracted the observations from the [tundra bean goose](https://www.gbif.org/species/6178319) (_Anser fabalis rossicus_, fig. \@ref(fig:tundra-bean-goose)). The dataset was limited to those locations with at leat 6 occurences during at least 3 years. Months with lower number of count were removed. Fig. \@ref(fig:observed-total) indicates the sum of all observed geese in the data. Note that these totals are somewhat misleading since there are a fair amount of missing observations (fig. \@ref(fig:missing)). The geographic distribution of the data is given in fig. \@ref(fig:map-goose).

# `INLA` vs `inlabru`

## Fixed effects only

Let's start with a very simple model with contains only the year centered to the last year. The syntax of both models is very similar. `bru()` is a bit shorted because it returns both $WAIC$ and $DIC$ by default. The models are identical because `bru()` is just a wrapper for `inla()`. Their summary output is somewhat different in terms of lay-out and which information is given.

```{r load-inla}
library(INLA)
library(inlabru)
```

```{r fixed-continous}
goose %>%
  mutate(cyear = year - max(year)) -> goose
m0_inla <- inla(
  count ~ cyear, 
  data = goose, 
  family = "nbinomial", 
  control.compute = list(waic = TRUE, dic = TRUE)
)
m0_inlabru <- bru(count ~ cyear, data = goose, family = "nbinomial")
summary(m0_inla)
summary(m0_inlabru)
```

A drawback is that `bru()` doesn't handle factor fixed effects as expected. Luckily it yields a warning about invalid factor levels. Unfortunaltly you don't get the warning when getting the summary. You need to be critical and notice that the parameters of the model are not what you would expect. The workaround is to convert the factor variable into a set of dummy variables and use those. Creating the dummy variable is straight forward with `model.matrix`. But adding them to the model is not very efficient when you have factor variables with more than a just few levels.

```{r fixed-factor}
m1_inla <- inla(
  count ~ cyear + month, 
  data = goose, 
  family = "nbinomial", 
  control.compute = list(waic = TRUE, dic = TRUE)
)
m1_inlabru <- bru(count ~ cyear + month, data = goose, family = "nbinomial")
summary(m1_inla)
summary(m1_inlabru)
goose %>% 
  model.matrix(object = ~month) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  select(-1) %>%
  bind_cols(goose) -> goose
m1_inlabru <- bru(
  count ~ cyear + monthdec + monthjan + monthfeb, 
  data = goose, 
  family = "nbinomial"
)
summary(m1_inlabru)
```

## Random effects

`inla()` use the `f()` function to specify the random effects. `bru()` is very liberal and allows the user to choose any name, as long as it is a valid function name. In the example below we use `site`. For more detail see `help("bru.components")`. The downside is that `bru()` requires integer coded levels which go from 1 to the number of levels. We use the `as.integer(factor())` trick to get these indices. Furthermore you need to supply the number of levels in the random effect for some random effects models.

```{r random-iid}
comp_inla <- count ~ cyear + month + f(location_id, model = "iid")
m2_inla <- inla(
  comp_inla, data = goose, family = "nbinomial", 
  control.compute = list(waic = TRUE, dic = TRUE)
)
goose %>%
  mutate(
    loc_id = factor(location_id) %>%
      as.integer()
  ) -> goose
n_loc <- max(goose$loc_id)
comp_inlabru <- count ~ cyear + monthdec + monthjan + monthfeb + 
  site(map = loc_id, model = "iid", n = n_loc)
m2_inlabru <- bru(comp_inlabru, data = goose, family = "nbinomial")
summary(m2_inla)
summary(m2_inlabru)
```

The use of user defined names for random effect functions has the benefit that you can use the same variable multiple times in the model. `inla()` requires unique names and hence copies of the variable. The `map` argument also allows to use a function of a variable, thus removing the need of creating a new variable. The `model = "linear"` is another way of specifying a continuous fixed effect. See http://www.r-inla.org/models/latent-models for an overview of all available latent models in INLA.

```{r random-alternatives}
goose %>%
  mutate(
    cyear = cyear - min(cyear) + 1,
    cyear2 = cyear
  ) -> goose2
n_year <- max(goose2$cyear)
comp_inla <- count ~ cyear + f(cyear2, model = "iid") + 
  month + f(location_id, model = "iid")
m3_inla <- inla(
  comp_inla, data = goose2, family = "nbinomial", 
  control.compute = list(waic = TRUE, dic = TRUE)
)
comp_inlabru <- count ~ cyear + rtrend(map = cyear, model = "iid", n = n_year) +
  monthdec + monthjan + monthfeb + site(map = loc_id, model = "iid", n = n_loc)
m3_inlabru <- bru(comp_inlabru, data = goose2, family = "nbinomial")
comp_inlabru <- count ~ 
  lintrend(map = cyear, model = "linear") + 
  quadtrend(map = cyear ^ 2, model = "linear") +
  rtrend(map = cyear, model = "iid", n = n_year) +
  monthdec + monthjan + monthfeb + site(map = loc_id, model = "iid", n = n_loc)
m3_inlabru2 <- bru(comp_inlabru, data = goose2, family = "nbinomial")
summary(m3_inlabru2)
```

## Meshed random effects

One of the great benefits of `inlabru` is that it makes it much easier to work with random effects on a mesh. The current data are geographic coordinates in "WGS84". For this analysis we want them in a projected coordinate system. "Belgian Lambert 72" [EPSG:31370](https://epsg.io/31370) is a relevant choice. Therefore we convert the data into a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` and transform it to EPSG:31370.

Instead of using a convex hull of the locations, we will use the administrative borders of [Flanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders) as a boundary for the mesh. The simplified version of this border is the blue line in fig. \@ref(fig:flanders-mesh)). Note that the mesh extents this border because that reduces potential edge effects. The detail of the mesh is defined by `cutoff` and `max.edge`, the former defines the minimal length of each edge and the latter the maximal length. These lengths have the same units as the coordinate system, in this case meters. We pass two numbers for both arguments. The first refers to the edges inside the boundary, the second to edges outside the boundary. This creates larger triangles outside the boundary, which will speed up the computation.

```{r flanders-mesh, fig.cap = "Mesh for Flanders. Red circles indicate the sites.", message = FALSE}
SpatialPointsDataFrame(
  coords = goose %>%
    select(long, lat),
  data = goose %>%
    select(loc_id, year, month, count, monthdec, monthjan, monthfeb),
  proj4string = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
) %>%
  spTransform(CRS("+init=epsg:31370")) -> goose_lambert
library(rgdal)
readOGR("../../data/20180712/vlaanderen.shp") %>%
  as.inla.mesh.segment() -> flanders_segment
inla.mesh.2d(
  boundary = flanders_segment, 
  max.edge = c(10e3, 20e3), 
  cutoff = c(5e3, 10e3)
) -> flanders_mesh
plot(flanders_mesh)
points(goose_lambert, col = "red")
```

Once the mesh is defined, we can create the [stochastic partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_partial_differential_equation) SPDE model. In this case we define it using a [Mat√©rn covariance function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat%C3%A9rn_covariance_function).

```{r}
flanders_spde <- inla.spde2.pcmatern(
  flanders_mesh,
  prior.range = c(1, 0.01),
  prior.sigma = c(4, 0.01)
)
```

All steps upto this point are needed for both `INLA::inla()` and `inlabr::bru()`. In case of `INLA::inla()` you need use `inla.spde.make.A()` to define a project matrix. This matrix maps the coordinates of the observation to the three nodes of the triangle in which it is located. In the special case that the observation is on a edge it will map to the two nodes defining the edge, or the node itself in case the observation coincides with a node. Then you need to define a `inla.stack()`, which is passed to the `data` argument after transforming it with `inla.stack.data()`. The SPDE object is used as `model` in the random effect 'site'.

The same model is much easier with `inlabr::bru()`. In this case you need to pass a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` to the `data` argument. The random effect 'site' has the SPDE object as `model` and uses "coordinates" as `map`. In this case there is no object "coordinates" in the data, hence `inlabr::bru()` will look in the environment and finds the `sp::coordinates()` function. This functions returns the coordinates of a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`, so `inlabr::bru()` has all the information it needs to map the observations to the SPDE object.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## INLA
A <- inla.spde.make.A(mesh = flanders_mesh, loc = goose_lambert)
goose_stack <- inla.stack(
  tag = 'estimation', ## tag
  data = list(count = goose$count), ## response
  A = list(A, 1), ## two projector matrices (SPDE and fixed effects)
  effects = list(## two elements:
    site = seq_len(flanders_spde$n.spde), ## RF index
    goose %>%
      select(cyear, month)
  )
)
comp_inla <- count ~ 0 + month + cyear +
  f(site, model = flanders_spde)
m4_inla <- inla(
  comp_inla, 
  data = inla.stack.data(goose_stack), family = "nbinomial", 
  control.compute = list(waic = TRUE, dic = TRUE),
  control.predictor = list(A = inla.stack.A(goose_stack))
)

# inlabru
comp_inlabru <- count ~ monthdec + monthjan + monthfeb + cyear +
  site(map = coordinates, model = flanders_spde)
m4_inlabru <- bru(comp_inlabru, data = goose_lambert, family = "nbinomial")
```

We can also create 1 dimensional meshes. This is useful for line transects or (irregural) time series.

```{r}
trend_mesh <- inla.mesh.1d(min(goose$year):max(goose$year), boundary = "free")
trend_spde <- inla.spde2.pcmatern(
  trend_mesh,
  prior.range = c(1, 0.5),
  prior.sigma = c(4, 0.01)
)
comp_inlabru <- count ~ monthdec + monthjan + monthfeb +
  trend(map = year, model = trend_spde) +
  site(map = coordinates, model = flanders_spde)
m4b_inlabru <- bru(comp_inlabru, data = goose_lambert, family = "nbinomial")
```

## Plotting the model

`plot.inla()` is an easy way to generate most of the relevant plots with a single command. It will open several plot windows to keep the plots readable. However this doesn't work well in combination with Rmarkdown. `plot.bru()` has the opposite phylosophy: you get the plot of only one component. Getting a plot for all components is a bit more tedious, but the advantage is that you can use it in combination with Rmarkdown. Another nice feature is that `plot.bru()` returns `ggplot2` object. So they are easy to adapt, see e.g. fig. \@ref(fig:plot-fixed). `inlabru` also provides a `multiplot()` function whcih can be used to combine several plots.

```{r rw1-models}
pc_prior <- list(theta = list(prior = "pc.prec", param = c(1, 0.01)))
goose %>%
  mutate(iyear = cyear - min(cyear) + 1) -> goose
n_year <- max(goose$iyear)
comp_inla <- count ~ month + 
  f(cyear, model = "rw1", hyper = pc_prior) + 
  f(location_id, model = "iid", hyper = pc_prior)
m5_inla <- inla(
  comp_inla, data = goose, family = "nbinomial", 
  control.compute = list(waic = TRUE, dic = TRUE)
)
comp_inlabru <- count ~ monthdec + monthjan + monthfeb + 
  trend(map = iyear, model = "rw1", n = n_year, hyper = pc_prior) +
  site(map = loc_id, model = "iid", n = n_loc, hyper = pc_prior)
m5_inlabru <- bru(comp_inlabru, data = goose, family = "nbinomial")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
plot(m5_inla)
```

```{r plot-fixed, fig.cap = "Posterior density plots of the fixed effects"}
p_intercept <- plot(m5_inlabru) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +
  xlim(-1, 4)
p_monthdec <- plot(m5_inlabru, "monthdec") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +
  xlim(-1, 4)
p_monthjan <- plot(m5_inlabru, "monthjan") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +
  xlim(-1, 4)
p_monthfeb <- plot(m5_inlabru, "monthfeb") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +
  xlim(-1, 4)
multiplot(p_intercept, p_monthdec, p_monthjan, p_monthfeb)
```

```{r, fig.cap = "Posterior density of the trend random intercepts."}
plot(m5_inlabru, "trend")
```

```{r fig.cap = "Posterior density of the site random intercepts."}
plot(m5_inlabru, "site")
```

### Plotting meshes

The mesh effects can be plot in a similar way. The default plot will display the estimate effect at each node. While this can be useful for 1D plot with a small number of nodes (top of fig. \@ref(fig:mesh-plot)), this is not useful for 2D meshes or meshed with a large number of nodes (bottom of fig. \@ref(fig:mesh-plot)). Looking at the posterior distributions for the range and the variance of the Mat√©rn covariance structure of SPDE model makes more sense (fig. \@ref(fig:mesh-range-var)). Or plot the actual Mat√©rn functions (fig. \@ref(fig:matern-function)).

```{r mesh-plot, fig.cap = "Posterior density of the random intercepts at the nodes of the mesh."}
p_trend <- plot(m4b_inlabru, "trend")
p_site <- plot(m4b_inlabru, "site")
multiplot(p_trend, p_site)
```

```{r mesh-range-var, fig.cap = "Posterior distributions of the range and log variance of the Mat√©rn covariace for the sites."}
spde.range <- spde.posterior(m4b_inlabru, "site", what = "range")
spde.logvar <- spde.posterior(m4b_inlabru, "site", what = "log.variance")
range.plot <- plot(spde.range)
var.plot <- plot(spde.logvar)
multiplot(range.plot, var.plot)
```

```{r matern-function, fig.cap = "Fitted Mat√©rn covariance and correlation functions."}
spde.posterior(m4b_inlabru, "site", what = "matern.covariance") %>%
  plot() +
  xlab("distance") +
  ylab("covariance") -> covplot
spde.posterior(m4b_inlabru, "site", what = "matern.correlation") %>%
  plot()  +
  xlab("distance") +
  ylab("correlation") -> corplot
multiplot(covplot, corplot)
```
