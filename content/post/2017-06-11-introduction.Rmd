I have no idea where this blog will lead. Current plans are a review of the [PeerSonic  BatDetector](http://peersonic.co.uk/), some examples of how batdetector observations can be analysed and some questions that I get repeatedly while giving statistical consultancy to ecologists and other scientists.

Another goal is more technical: learn to create a website with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).
