      <description>I have no idea where this blog will lead. Current plans are a review of the PeerSonic BatDetector, some examples of how bat detector observations can be analysed and some questions that I get repeatedly while giving statistical consultancy to ecologists and other scientists.
Another goal is more technical: learn to create a website with blogdown. The easy road would be to render the sources files locally in to a complete website and upload that.</description>
