      <description>When we analyse a mixed models, the question often arises whether a covariate should be used as a random effect or as a fixed effects. Let’s assume a simple design. Two types of fertilizer are tested on a number of fields (\(n_s\)). Each field is split in two and the fertilizers are assigned at random to these halves while making sure that each field has both treatments. From a conceptual point of view, we are only interested in the effect of the fertilizers.</description>

      <title>Comparing inlabru with INLA</title>

      <description>inlabru is an R package which builds on top of the INLA package. I had the opportunity to take a workshop on it during the International Statistical Ecology Workshop ISEC2018 in St Andrews. This was a five day workshop condensed into a single day, hence the pace was very high. It gave us a good overview of the possibilities of inlabru but no time to try it on our own data.</description>

      <title>Temporal autocorrelation in INLA</title>

      <description>One of the reason why I often use INLA is because it allows for correlated random effects. In this blog post, I will handle random effect with temporal autocorrelation. INLA has several options for this. There are two major types of model, the first handles discrete time step, the latter continuous time steps.
Dummy data set This blog post was inspired by a post on the R-Sig-Mixed models mailing list.</description>

      <description>Recently, I got a question on a mixed model with highly correlated random slopes. I requested a copy of the data because it is much easier to diagnose the problem when you have the actual data. The data owner gave permission to use an anonymised version of the data for this blog post. In this blog post, I will discuss how I’d tackle this problem.
Data exploration Every data analysis should start with some data exploration.</description>

      <title>Using a variable both as fixed and random effect</title>
      <link>/2017/08/fixed-and-random/</link>

      <description>Categorical variable Discrete variable Intro Fit with lme4 Fit with INLA  Continuous variable Conclusion    One of the questions to answer when using mixed models is whether to use a variable as a fixed effect or as a random effect. Sometimes it makes sense to use a variable both as fixed and random effect. In this post I will try to make clear in which cases it can make sense and what are the benefits of doing so.</description>

      <title>Nested and crossed random effects in &#34;lme4&#34;</title>

      <description>People often get confused on how to code nested and crossed random effects in the lme4 package. I will try to make this more clear using some artificial data sets.
Nested random effects Nested random effects assume that there is some kind of hierarchy in the grouping of the observations. E.g. schools and classes. A class groups a number of students and a school groups a number of classes.</description>

      <title>Estimating densities from a point pattern</title>

      <description>In this example we focus on a set of 10450 coordinates in a small area. The goal is to estimate the local density of points, expressed as the number of point per unit area. The raw coordinates are given in WGS84 (EPSG:4326), which is a geodetic coordinate system. That is not suited for calculating distances, so we need to re-project the points into a local projected coordinate system.</description>
