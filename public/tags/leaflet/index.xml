      <description>In this example we focus on a set of 10450 coordinates in a small area. The goal is to estimate the local density of points, expressed as the number of point per unit area. The raw coordinates are given in WGS84 (EPSG:4326), which is a geodetic coordinate system. That is not suited for calculating distances, so we need to re-project the points into a local projected coordinate system.</description>

      <description>This post will handle observations of bats along a set of transects. It is a work in progress simply because Iâ€™m still collecting more data. So come back once and awhile to see potential updates.
The survey The principle of the survey is quite simple: walk around with a bat detector and note the route you took and were you encounter bats. Repeat this several times.</description>
