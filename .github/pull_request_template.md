<!-- Please check if the following steps are OK:-->

- [ ] My tutorial or article is placed in a subfolder of `tutorials/content`
- [ ] The filename of my tutorial or article is `index.md`. In case of an Rmarkdown tutorial I have knitted my `index.Rmd` to `index.md` (both files are pushed to the repo). 
- [ ] I have included `tags` in the YAML header (see the tags listed in the [tutorials website side bar](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/) for tags that have been used before)
- [ ] I have added `categories` to the YAML header and my category tags are from the [list of category tags](https://github.com/inbo/tutorials/blob/master/static/list_of_categories)
